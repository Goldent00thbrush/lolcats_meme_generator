# lolcats meme generator 
A simple web app built in html and JavaScript.

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to dive deeper into front end web app development. The idea is building a meme generator which translates English into lolcats lingo. The user gets to assemble the meme as they please.  The idea was inspired by my desire to do a fun web app mixed with lolcats. 
## The App
The front-end of the app can be seen here: https://goldent00thbrush.github.io/lolcats_meme_generator  
## Technologies 
-	HTML 5
-	Javascript 
## Features/Components 
-	A script.js file containing all the js functions.
-   A style.css containing all the styling info.
-   A index.html containing all html elements.
## Status 
The project is done. It took around 16 hours to develop (4 hours per week for 4 weeks).
## Future development
If the development of this project picks up again, here are things to work on or improve:
-	Change the hard-coding of the images and lolcats dictionary into separate local files. 
-	Save the meme in png or jpg format. 
-	Add a font size and color wheel options.
## Acknowledgments 
-	The styling css file was heavily inspired from  https://github.com/fourtyone11/origin-hugo-theme/blob/master/assets/scss/_header.scss
-	The lolcats lingo was adopted from https://github.com/SimplifiedBanana101/lolcat-translator/blob/master/code (Note: lolcatbible would have been a comprehensive source but it seems unreachable atm).
